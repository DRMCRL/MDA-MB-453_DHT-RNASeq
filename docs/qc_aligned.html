Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/DRMCRL/MDA-MB-453_DHT-RNASeq/tree/85263569946f6286cf6f83fa1cf0d4b03c70d430" target="_blank">8526356</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  output/genesGR.rds

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/qc_aligned.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/qc_aligned.html</code>) files.

<p>Read assignment to genes was performed using Ensembl release 101 which used the genome build GRCh38 for generation of gene models. When assigning reads to genes, <code>featureCounts</code> was run setting the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Libraries were assumed to be <em>unstranded</em></li>
<li>The <em>minimum percentage</em> of a read which needed to overlap an exon before being counted was 90%</li>
<li>In addition to the minimum percentage, <em>a minimum of 35 bases</em> must also overlap an exon before a read is counted</li>
<li>The <em>minimum alignment quality score</em> for a read to be counted was 1</li>
<li>Counting of multi-mapped reads was permitted using fractional counts</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>The percentages of reads assigned to genes ranged between <em>56.5%</em> and <em>65.3%</em></li>
<li>Of the total reads:
<ul>
<li>Between <em>0%</em> and <em>0%</em> were unassigned due to multi-mapping</li>
<li>Between <em>3.8%</em> and <em>9.2%</em> were aligned but didn’t overlap any known genes</li>
<li>Between <em>0.85%</em> and <em>1.11%</em> were unassigned as they failed the proportion overlapping criteria</li>
<li>Between <em>4.0%</em> and <em>5.3%</em> were unassigned as they were considered ambiguous</li>
</ul></li>

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
