Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/DRMCRL/MDA-MB-453_DHT-RNASeq/tree/745652668b05303a256e152a6d4c1dabe18c8fdd" target="_blank">7456526</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   output/MDA-MB-453_RNASeq.tsv
    Modified:   output/dge.rds

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.
</p>

<p>
These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/dge_analysis.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/dge_analysis.html</code>) files. If you’ve configured a remote Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the hyperlinks in the table below to view the files as they were in that past version.

<p>This data set is slightly unique in that samples were sequenced across multiple lanes and flowcells. Metadata was re-organised to enable summarising of counts across the multiple sequencing runs obtained for every sample. The <a href="qc_aligned.html#pca">initial PCA</a> showed that variability between replicates and flowcells was dwarfed by variability between samples. As such, all counts were able to be merged to give a single set of counts for each individual sample.</p>

<p>Given that previous work had only assessed the libraries prior to merging, the library sizes were checked after merging replicate sequencing runs. The median library size was found to be 13.6 million reads which is just above the common-use minimum recommendation of 10 million reads/sample.</p>
<p>However, sample MDA6 was below the common-use minimum library size in both treatment groups and whilst discarding this sample is not advised, this should be noted for all downstream analysis. Similarly, the DHT-treated sample for MDA2 showed a library size which was nearly double the rest of the samples</p>

<p>Despite concerns raised by the library sizes, sample MDA6 appears to be relatively consistent with other samples of the same treatment group. However, MDA2 showed significant divergence from the others in both treatment groups, whilst the vehicle-treated (i.e. control) sample from MDA5 was also a notable outlier.</p>
</div>
<div id="checks-for-gc-and-length-bias" class="section level2">
<h2>Checks for GC and Length bias</h2>
<p>Given the clear unexpected variability captured by PC1, the impact of GC content or length bias was assessed as a possible source.</p>
<p>Genes were divided in 10 approximately equal sized bins based on increasing length, and 10 approximately equal sized bins based on increasing GC content, with the final GC/Length bins being the combination 100 bins using both sets. The contribution of each gene to PC1 and PC2 was assessed and a t-test performed on each bin. This tests</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H_0: \mu = 0 \text{ against } H_A: \mu \neq 0
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> represents the true contribution to PC1 of all genes in that bin.</p>
<p>If any bin makes a contribution to PC1 the mean will be clearly non-zero, whilst if there is no contribution the mean will be near zero. In this way, the impact of gene length and GC content on variance within the dataset can be assessed. As seen below, the contribution of GC content and gene length to PC1 is very clear, with a smaller contribution being evident across PC2. As a result, Conditional Quantile Normalisation (<code>CQN</code>) is recommended in preference to the more common TMM normalisation.</p>

<p>CQN clearly had a positive impact on the data, however, the exclusion of replicate 2 may still be an option. Given the consistency seen with the post-CQN PCA, using a blocking approach will also be the preferred analytic approach.</p>

<p>In order to detect genes which respond to DHT the Null Hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) was specified to be a range around zero, instead of the conventional point-value.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H_0: -\lambda \leq \mu \leq \lambda \\
\text{Vs.} \\
H_A: |\mu| &gt; \lambda
\]</span></p>
<p>This characterises <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> as being a range instead of being the singularity 0, with <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> representing the true mean logFC. The default value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = \log_2 1.2 = 0.263\)</span> was chosen. This removes any requirement for <em>post hoc</em> filtering based on logFC. Using this approach, 619 genes were considered as DE to an FDR of 0.05. Of these, 387 were up-regulated with the remaining 232 being down-regulated.</p>

<h2>Exclusion of Replicate 2</h2>
<p>Given the concerns raised by the above MA plot and the checks for bias, the above analysis was repeated, excluding replicate 2 (not shown). Whilst results were broadly comparable, this did not improve the bias observed in the low-expressed genes. Instead, this bias was attributed to genes expressed at low levels in only one of the treatment groups.</p>
<p>Any enrichment analysis should incorporate a bias offset, such as offered by the package <code>goseq</code>. Enrichment analysis using ranked lists should be undertaken with caution.</p>

<div id="data-export" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Export</h2>
<p>These above results were exported as the file <code>MDA-MB-453_RNASeq.tsv</code>.</p>
